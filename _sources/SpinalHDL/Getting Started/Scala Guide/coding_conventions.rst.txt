Coding conventions
==================

Introduction
------------

The coding conventions used in SpinalHDL are the same as the ones documented in the `scala doc <https://docs.scala-lang.org/style/>`_.

Some additional practical details and cases are explained in next chapters.

class vs case class
-------------------

When you define a ``Bundle`` or a ``Component``, have a preference to declare them as case class.

The reasons are:

* It avoids the use of ``new`` keywords. Never having to use it is better than sometimes under some conditions.
* A ``case class`` provides an ``clone`` function. This is useful in SpinalHDL where there is a need to clone one Bundle. For example, when you define a new ``Reg`` or a new ``Stream`` of some kind.
* Construction parameters are directly visible from outside.

[case] class
^^^^^^^^^^^^

All classes names should start with a upper case letter

.. code-block:: scala

   class Fifo extends Component {

   }

   class Counter extends Area {

   }

   case class Color extends Bundle {

   }

companion object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A companion object should start with a upper case letter.

.. code-block:: scala

   object Fifo {
     def apply(that: Stream[Bits]): Stream[Bits] = {...}
   }

   object MajorityVote {
     def apply(that: Bits): UInt = {...}
   }

An exception to this rule is when the companion object is used as a function (only ``apply`` inside), and these ``apply`` functions don't generate hardware:

.. code-block:: scala

   object log2{
     def apply(value: Int): Int = {...}
   }

function
^^^^^^^^

A function should always start with a lower case letter:

.. code-block:: scala

   def sinTable = (0 until sampleCount).map(sampleIndex => {
     val sinValue = Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * sampleIndex / sampleCount)
     S((sinValue * ((1 << resolutionWidth) / 2 - 1)).toInt, resolutionWidth bits)
   })

   val rom =  Mem(SInt(resolutionWidth bit),initialContent = sinTable)

instances
^^^^^^^^^

Instances of classes should always start with a lower case letter:

.. code-block:: scala

   val fifo   = new Fifo()
   val buffer = Reg(Bits(8 bits))

if / when
^^^^^^^^^

Scala ``if`` and SpinalHDL ``when`` should normally be written in the following way:

.. code-block:: scala

   if(cond){
     ...
   } else if(cond){

   } else {

   }

   when(cond){

   }.elseWhen(cond){

   }.otherwise{

   }

Exceptions could be:

* It's fine to omit the dot before ``otherwise``.
* It's fine to compress a whole ``if``\ /\ ``when`` statements on a single line if it makes the code more readable.

switch
^^^^^^

SpinalHDL switch should normally be written in the following way:

.. code-block:: scala

   switch(value){
     is(key){

     }
     is(key){

     }
     default{

     }
   }

It's fine to compress a ``is``\ /\ ``default`` statement on a single line if it makes the code more readable.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

Grouping parameters of a component/bundle inside a case class is in general welcome:


* Easier to carry/manipulate to configure the design
* Better maintainability

.. code-block:: scala

   case class RgbConfig(rWidth: Int, gWidth: Int, bWidth: Int){
     def getWidth = rWidth + gWidth + bWidth
   }

   case class Rgb(c: RgbConfig) extends Bundle {
     val r = UInt(c.rWidth bit)
     val g = UInt(c.gWidth bit)
     val b = UInt(c.bWidth bit)
   }

But this should not be applied in all cases. For example: in a Fifo, it doesn't make sense to group the dataType parameter with the depth of the fifo because, in general, the dataType is something related to the design, while the depth is something related to the configuration of the design.

.. code-block:: scala

   class Fifo[T <: Data](dataType: T, depth: Int) extends Component {

   }
