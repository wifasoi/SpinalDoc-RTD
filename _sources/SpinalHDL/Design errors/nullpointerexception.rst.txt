NullPointerException
====================

Introduction
------------

NullPointerException is an Scala runtime reported error which happen when a variable was accessed but wasn't initialised.

Example
-------

The following code :

.. code-block:: scala

   class TopLevel extends Component {
     a := 42
     val a = UInt(8 bits)
   }

will throw :

.. code-block:: text

   Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
     ***
     Source file location of the a := 42 assignement via the stack trace
     ***

A fix could be :

.. code-block:: scala

   class TopLevel extends Component {
     val a = UInt(8 bits)
     a := 42
   }

| **Issue explanation** :
| SpinalHDL is not a language, it is an Scala library, which mean, it obey to the same rules than the Scala general purpose programming language. When you run your SpinalHDL hardware description to generate the corresponding VHDL/Verilog RTL, your SpinalHDL hardware description will be executed as a Scala programm, and ``a`` will be a null reference until the programm execution come to that line, and it’s why you can’t use it before.
