Scope violation
===============

Introduction
------------

SpinalHDL will check that there no signals assigned outside it's declaration scope. This error isn't easy to trigger as it require some specific meta hardware description tricks.

Example
-------

The following code :

.. code-block:: scala

   class TopLevel extends Component {
     val cond = Bool()

     var tmp : UInt = null
     when(cond){
       tmp = UInt(8 bits)
     }
     tmp := U"x42"
   }

will throw :

.. code-block:: text

   SCOPE VIOLATION : (toplevel/tmp :  UInt[8 bits]) is assigned outside its declaration scope at
     ***
     Source file location of the tmp := U"x42" via the stack trace
     ***

A fix could be :

.. code-block:: scala

   class TopLevel extends Component {
     val cond = Bool()

     var tmp : UInt = UInt(8 bits)
     when(cond){

     }
     tmp := U"x42"
   }
