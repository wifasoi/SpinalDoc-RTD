Introduction
------------

The core of the language defines the syntax that provides many features :


* Types / Literals
* Register / Clock domains
* Component / Area
* RAM / ROM
* When / Switch / Mux
* BlackBox (to integrate VHDL or Verilog IP inside Spinal)
* SpinalHDL to VHDL converter

Then, by using these features, you can of course define digital hardware, but also build powerful libraries and abstractions. It's one of the major advantages of SpinalHDL over other commonly used HDLs, because you can extend the language without having knowledge about the compiler.

One good example of this is the :ref:`SpinalHDL lib <lib_introduction>` which adds many utilities, tools, buses and methodologies.

To use features introduced in the following chapter you need to ``import spinal.core._`` in your sources.
