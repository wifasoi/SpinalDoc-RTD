Introduction
============

Examples are split in tree kinds:

* Simple ones that could be used to get used to the basics of SpinalHDL.
* Intermediates ones which implement components by using a traditional approach.
* Advanced ones which go further than traditional HDL by using object oriented programming, functional programming, and meta-hardware description.

They are all accessible in the sidebar under the corresponding sections.

.. important::
   The SpinalHDL workshop contains many labs with their solutions. See `here <https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalWorkshop>`_.

.. note::
   You can also find a list of repostitories using SpinalHDL :ref:`there <users_repositories>`
